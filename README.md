# BikeEverything
An analysis tool for pushbike riders.  This tool feattures:
- Power output calculations based upon rider and bike parameters
- Optimum tyre pressure and gearing calculators
- Metric/imperial conversion calculators
- Facility to import and analyse a .GPX or .TCX activity file
- Metabolic energy calculator
- Time / energy prediction for a ride based upon user power output limits
- Gel and water requirement calculators for a ride

This project is written in vanilla Javascript, and is installed and run on a client system. Aside from a Javascript browser, all dependancies are included in the project (ie no need for Node.js, React, jQuery etc etc). This code will consequently require CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin enabled to run

Start by opening bikeEVerything.html in a browser window.

This is a running program but is still a work in progress, so not all features are complete. The code was developed for the Chrome browser under Microsoft Windows, so may render differently under other browsers. Limited testing has been completed under *nix and MacOS environments, with no real operability tests on the iOS environment for an iPhone and iPad.

TODO:
- Lactate modelling
- Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) analysis
- Prediction of optimum ride strategy based upon user's cardiac limits
